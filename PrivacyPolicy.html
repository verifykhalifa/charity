          <p><strong>Business Transitions</strong></p>

          <p>
            In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a
            merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion
            of our assets, your personally identifiable information will likely
            be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent
            notice on our Site of any such change in ownership or control of
            your Personal Information.

          <p><strong>Do Not Track Disclosures</strong></p>

          <p>
            Q:&nbsp;How do we respond to Web browser “do not track” signals or
            other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise
            choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable
            information about an individual consumer’s online activities over
            time and across third-party websites or online services?
          </p>

          <p>
            A:&nbsp;We currently do not respond to DNT signals in browsers
            because we do not track individual users across the web.
